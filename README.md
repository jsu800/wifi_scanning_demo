Wifi, Google Fused Location Provider, Cellular, GPS

This demo illustrates the use of WiFi, cellular network, GPS, sensors, and a combination of those to arrive at proximity 
estimation mostly for indoor applications. A side module in this application uses Google's fused location provider API 
to arrive at location updates and Android's built in Activity sensors to determine user's indoor location and orientation
in real time.
